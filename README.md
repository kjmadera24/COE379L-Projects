# COE379L Class Projects #

This repository contains projects for the course COE379L: Software Design For Responsible Intelligent Systems. Each project addresses different aspects of software design and implementation related to responsible intelligent systems.

## Projects

### Project 1: Automobile Exploratory Analysis ###

In this project, the goal was to perform an exploratory analysis of a specific dataset and prepare it for predictive analysis using an intelligent system. My primary objective was to achieve the highest accuracy percentage for predictive analysis and fit it to a Linear Regression model. This serves the purpose of applying skills in data preparation for ease of use and responsible system manipulation to be able to generate accurate predictive results.

### Project 2: Breast Cancer Recurrence Analysis ###

The goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of a specific dataset and prepare it for predictive analysis using intelligent system techniques. The aim is to develop a learning model with supervised learning techniques to predict the recurrence of breast cancer in patients.

### Project 3: Hurricane Damage Classification

In this project, I aimed to classify satellite images captured after Hurricane Harvey in Texas as either depicting damaged or undamaged areas. The goal is to develop intelligent systems using neural networks to accurately identify damaged properties, thereby facilitating efficient disaster response and damage control efforts.
